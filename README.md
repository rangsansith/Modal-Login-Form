# Modal-Login-Form
This is a login form which was created using the twitter bootstrap framework. It validates input on the client-side and the server-side. The client-side is built using the JQUERY library while the server-side is built using PHP. The form validates on the fly meaning that it validates the user inputs as the user types into the form.
